coderunner.nvim is a plugin for runnning your code. It helps you test your code blazing fastly!
PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS PLUGIN IS STILL HEAVILY WIP AND I AM WRITING IT ONLY AS
AN EXERCISE FOR ME ON LUA(I DON'T KNOW IF I WILL COMPLETE IT :\)


                                            *:lua require("coderunner").run()*
This is the main function that this plugin depends on, just you can set a
keymap for it and boom you are ready :), just follow that:

    local coderunner = require("coderunner")
    vim.keymap.set("n", your-keymap, coderunner.run)

                                                                    *Features*
